## Review

This homework was pretty challenging, but I thought I did a pretty good job using promise based behavior to complete it. I was stuck on the JOINS for quite a long time, but Dave's review helped me out a lot. I didn't end up getting to all the bonuses, but I think that I maybe hit one or two.
